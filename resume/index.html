    <!-- Summary -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a game designer and developer with a strong background in
        large-scale commercial game production, most notably at Ubisoft RedLynx.
        My work has spanned mobile and console projects, onboarding and retention
        systems, meta-design, and collaboration across multidisciplinary teams.
        <br><br>
        Over time, my priorities have shifted toward applying these skills
        outside of pure entertainment. I am increasingly focused on building
        tools, systems, and experiences that align with ethical values —
        particularly animal rights, transparency, and education.
        <br><br>
        This website, and my current career direction, represent an intentional
        move toward technology that informs, empowers, and contributes
        positively beyond traditional commercial products.

      <h2>Experience Timeline</h2>

      <h3>Ubisoft RedLynx — Helsinki, Finland</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Senior Game Designer</strong><br>
        April 2024 – Present
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing my design role at Ubisoft RedLynx across multiple mobile and
        console-related initiatives.
        <br><br>
        Current focus includes assessing new opportunities in the AAA mobile
        space (Rainbow Six Mobile and beyond), contributing to design research,
        and helping align RedLynx initiatives with Ubisoft’s broader strategy.
        <br><br>
        I also contributed to <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for Switch, supporting
        design work, researching engine capabilities, and identifying UX and
        technical adaptations required for the platform.
        <br><br>
        A significant part of this role involves developing a deep
        understanding of Ubisoft’s in-house technology (Snowdrop engine) and
        how design decisions can fully leverage its systems and constraints.

      <p>
        <strong>Game Designer</strong><br>
        October 2022 – April 2024
      </p>
      <p>
        Core designer on <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, with a strong focus on
        First-Time User Experience (FTUE), onboarding, player retention,
        conversion, and monetisation feedback.
        <br><br>
        The project is soft-launched in multiple territories (including Canada
        and Latin America), with Ubisoft Montreal as the head studio.
        <br><br>
        On RedLynx’s side, I led the design vision and coordination for all
        onboarding-related systems, while also providing structured feedback
        on meta progression and monetisation design.

      <h3>Previous Industry Experience (Context)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Nitro Games Plc — Game Designer / Lead Game Designer</strong><br>
        2017 – 2022
      </p>
      <p>
        Worked across multiple mobile titles and internal projects, including
        Lootland and Runegate Heroes. Responsibilities ranged from core gameplay
        and metagame design to monetisation and FTUE.
        <br><br>
        As Lead Game Designer, I held design ownership on a mobile project in
        collaboration with Supermassive Games, leading a team of designers and
        defining the project vision from concept to production.

    <!-- Direction -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Current Direction & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I am intentionally transitioning away from entertainment-only work
        toward projects that support animal rights, ethical decision-making,
        and transparency.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to collaborate with organizations, researchers, or advocacy
        groups that need robust, well-designed technical tools rather than
        marketing-driven products.
        <br><br>
        I am particularly interested in projects where technology helps people
        understand complex systems, consequences, and choices — and where
        interactivity can meaningfully support awareness and change.
