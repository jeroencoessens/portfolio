    <!-- Summary -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a developer with a background in game development and
        interactive entertainment, having worked at studios such as
        Ubisoft and Nitro Games.
        <br><br>
        Over time, I have become increasingly focused on using my
        technical and creative skills for projects that align with
        ethical values — particularly animal rights, transparency,
        and education.
        <br><br>
        This website represents an intentional shift toward building
        tools and experiences that contribute positively beyond
        entertainment.

      <h2>Experience Timeline</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Game & Entertainment Industry</strong>
        <br>
        Worked in professional game development environments,
        contributing to large-scale commercial projects.
        <br><br>
        Companies include:
        <br>
        – Ubisoft
        <br>
        – Nitro Games
        <br><br>
        This period built a strong foundation in software development,
        production pipelines, collaboration across disciplines,
        and shipping polished user-facing products.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Independent & Purpose-Driven Work</strong>
        <br>
        Increasing focus on smaller, value-aligned projects where
        technology is used to inform, visualize, or empower.
        <br><br>
        Current efforts explore how tools traditionally used in games
        — interactivity, visualization, systems thinking — can support
        animal advocacy and education.

    <!-- Skills -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Skills & Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical</strong>
        <br>
        Game development, software engineering, interactive systems,
        prototyping, data visualization, tooling.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Product & Collaboration</strong>
        <br>
        Working within multidisciplinary teams, iterating on user
        feedback, balancing scope with impact.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Transferable Focus</strong>
        <br>
        Applying game development skills to non-game contexts:
        clarity, engagement, and meaningful user experience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Direction -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Current Direction & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I am actively transitioning away from purely entertainment-driven
        work toward projects that support animal rights, transparency,
        and ethical decision-making.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to collaborate with organizations, activists, or
        researchers who need practical, well-designed technical tools
        rather than marketing-driven products.
        <br><br>
        I am especially interested in projects where technology helps
        people better understand complex systems and their real-world
        consequences.
